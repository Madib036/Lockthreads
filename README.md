# Features

# GitHub Codespaces ♥️ React

    Welcome to your shiny new Codespace running React

We've got everything fired up and running for you to explore React.
You've got a blank canvas to work on from a git perspective as well. There's a single initial commit with the what you're seeing right now - where you go from here is up to you! Everything you do here is contained within this one codespace. There is no repository on GitHub yet. If and when you’re ready you can click "Publish Branch" and we’ll create your repository and push up your project. If you were just exploring then and have no further need for this code then you can simply delete your codespace and it's gone forever.
    
# This project was bootstrapped for you with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

# Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

# npm start

We've already run this for you in the `Codespaces: server` terminal window below. If you need to stop the server for any reason you can just run `npm start` again to bring it back online. Runs the app in the development mode.

# Running Your Application in development mode
