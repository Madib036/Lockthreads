The future of WordPress is here. Titan allows you to design individual sections and which can then be reused with ease.

== Description ==
###Brief Description
WP Titan Elements was created for the sole purpose of being a better more efficient visual designer. Titan's revolutionary design comes from the fact that allows for 100% freedom. It enables beginners to have a great enjoyable experience, but at the same time doesn't hinder the more advanced users. The biggest problem with most of the other visual designer is the speed. Thousands of shortcode that need to be interpreted before every runtime. Titan only uses one shortcode and the information for the sections is stored in a json file. Normally data is constantly pulled from the database. Titan loads data in a lightning fast cacheable JSON file. Trust us once you use Titan you're never going to use another visual editor again.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Does Titan Elements have a premium version? =
No, and it probably never will.. I feel that a premium version leads to the degradation of the **free** version.

= If you don't monetize, how can you continue the upgrades and free support? =
I might create some premium elements or sister plugins. I have already been considering an A/B testing add-on that can be used to test per individual section.
